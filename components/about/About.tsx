          Iâ€™m a frontend developer that finished my studies at Noroff School of technology and
          digital media in Oslo, Norway in 2022. I have been working with frontend development for 2
          years now and my interest in creative development comes from my passion to beeing able to
          create something from idea to a finished product. The opportunities and possibilities in
          web development is what inspires me to do what I do.
